# OS_Schedulers_SRTN_RR
Implementation of two types of schedulers, SRTN (Shortest Remaining Time Next) and Round Robin.

The code above is able to create an input file called "input.txt" that contains three information about some processes that will be organized at by the schedulers: the arrival time, the burst time and the priority (in theses scheduler, the priority hasn't been used). There are some functions to help the organization and visualization of the entire execution of the processes.
At the final of the execution, the code generates an output file ("output.txt") that shows the processes ordered by the correspondant ID.
